Our project is simple and tests you on your general knowledge. The questions are open response but are case sensitive, for every question you get right out of the 7, you get 10 points. The questions range for geography, pop culture, and even a language question. After you are done playing you get a message telling you that the game is over and you get the choice to either end the game completely or to restart the whole quiz.
