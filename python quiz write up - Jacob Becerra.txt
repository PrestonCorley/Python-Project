My partner and I had a couple of struggles with the while loops. But what we did and thanks to the help of Sam, made a global variable and assigned it to a number. Once the quiz ended, the number would go up one causing the game to end which you have an option for. We also allowed for the user to restart the game by rerunning the program after they chose the option to start again.
